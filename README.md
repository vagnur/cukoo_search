# Cukoo Search Algorithm

C++ implementation of the cuckoo search metaheuristic for optmization problems.

## Installation

In order to use the cuckoo search, you need to use the makefile of the repository:

```
~@ make 
```

## Usage

First, you need to declare the fitness function. In the code we have an example of a fitness function.

Then, you need a file that contains the minimun and maximun value of each parameter _i_, like this:

```
0 1 2 3 4
4 5 6 7 8
```

In this case the parameters min and max, when _i=3_ for example, are 2 and 6 respectively.

```python
[0.083, 0.25, 0.25, 0.417]
```
